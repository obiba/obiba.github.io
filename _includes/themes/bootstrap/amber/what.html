<p>Amber is a web-based application that manages case reports. As depicted in the figure below, it is a three tier system which components are:</p>

<ol class="obiba-carret-list">
  <li>
    <b>Presentation tier</b>
    <ul class="obiba-carret-list">
      <li><b>Amber Studio</b> is a front-end application that runs locally in the client's browser. It manages the users and the case report forms (design and access controls).</li>
      <li><b>Amber Collect</b> is a front-end application that runs locally in the client's browser or a mobile phone. It collects case reports data based on the enabled case report forms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Application tier</b>
    <ul class="obiba-carret-list">
      <li><b>Amber Server</b> is the core logic application that applies the data collection and authentication/authorization rules.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data tier</b>
    <ul class="obiba-carret-list">
      <li><b>MongoDB</b> is a the database used for storing the user profiles, the designed case report forms and the collected data (optionally encrypted).</li>
    </ul>

<p>Onyx controls both the order and availability of the interview stages (for example, no stages are available prior to
  the informed consent is signed) and captures many administrative parameters such as the starting and ending times of
  each stage. Onyx also manages a participant appointment list and reception of participants, as well as data
  filtering and encryption prior to export to a central study database (see <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a>).

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> What Onyx Can Do for You</h4>

<p>Onyx is designed to ensure that data is collected in an automated, efficient and secure way in order to minimize
  human errors and interview length. Onyx can optimize the workflow of your baseline interviews by:</p>
<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
  <li>Managing appointment lists and walk-ins.</li>
  <li>Controlling stage availability and dependencies (examples: requiring consent before an interview can proceed;
    dependent measurements).
  </li>
  <li>Capturing administrative parameters such as starting and ending times of each stage.</li>
  <li>Managing participant consents (electronic and handwritten).</li>
  <li>Administering health questionnaires electronically.</li>
  <li>Facilitating collection of biosamples (barcode scanning).</li>
  <li>Automating physical measurements.</li>
  <li>Producing personalized reports for participants.</li>
  <li>Exporting encrypted data to multiple destinations.</li>
</ul>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> A Highly Customizable Software Solution</h4>

<p> Onyx is modular as shown in the figure below. The Onyx engine is a backbone to which independent data collection
  components
  can be connected in order to manage the various interview stages. Studies can configure Onyx for their own specific
  stages and data collection software. </p>
