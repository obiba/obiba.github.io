    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Study Catalogue</h4>
</div>

<p>Mica provides study networks with a study catalogue module to describe in a standardized manner their membership.
    Mica study catalogue includes:</p>

<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>A default list of important study description characteristics that can be customized to reflect specific
        requirements,
    </li>
    <li>Support for longitudinal study design with data collection events, sub-populations and recruitment timelines.
    </li>
    <li>Advanced study search functionality using facets technologies.</li>
</ul>

<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Datasets</h4>
</div>

<p>Studies makes available different datasets to the research community. Mica provides:</p>

<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>A standard menu for its data resources,</li>
    <li>A detailed description of a dataset including a comprehensive dictionary of all the variables provided by the
        dataset,
    </li>
    <li>Advanced variable search functionality using facets technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">Importantly, Mica does not store any record-level data itself. Instead, Mica includes for
    studies using the OBiBa <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> software as
    main secured database solution, a distributed query engine that enables authorized researchers to obtain real-time
    aggregated reports on the exact number of participant with specific characteristics or phenotypes. The same engine
    is used to obtain summary statistics on each variable. Using this approach, no individual-level data passes through
    Mica, yet researchers can assess the suitability of a dataset for their needs. software as main secured database
