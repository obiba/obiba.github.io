<p>Mica is a powerful software application used to create rapidly web portals for large-scale single epidemiology
  studies or multiple-study consortia. Mica helps studies to provide scientifically robust data visibility and web
  presence without significant information technology effort.</p>

<p>Written as an integrated suite of modules for the Drupal open source content management system, Mica provides a
  structured description of studies, annotated and searchable data dictionaries, query interfaces for aggregated and
  de-identified data, data access request management and common page structures for publication lists and research
  events.
</p>

<p>Each module can be managed through Drupalâ€™s standard administration screens. Drupal modules from other sources can be
  installed alongside those provided by Mica to build an online personalized data portal.</p>
