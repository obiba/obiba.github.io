<p>This story is an impressive example of use of the OBIBA software to create a federated database enabling advanced
  analysis without divulging any individual-level data.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bioshare.eu/" target="_blank">BioSHaRE <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> is a
  European project which aims to standardize and harmonize data from some of the largest biobanks in
  Europe. More than 160 selected data elements from 13 European biobanks have been harmonized by <a href="http://www.maelstrom-research.org/" target="_blank">Maelstrom Research
    <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> and corresponding harmonized datasets were derived and stored
  on Opal software instances.</p>


<p>The 13 resulting databases were then securely federated through the Mica-based <a href="http://www.bioshare.eu/"
                                                                                     target="_blank">BioSHARE website <i
  class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> and the
  DataSHIELD R client (rstudio.bioshare.eu) to create a distributed dataset on more than 650,000 European subjects.
  Authorised researchers can now securely run distributed queries and statistical analyses on the harmonized data hosted
  on geographically-dispersed Opal servers. Queries from Mica allows remote retrieval of data summaries and descriptive
  statistics such as frequencies/counts, minimums, maximums, means, standard deviations, as well as contingency tables
  for each participating biobank in real time whereas DataSHIELD allows more advanced types of real time analyses such
  as generalized linear model fitting. In both cases, no individual-level data is ever transferred or disclosed to the
  researchers protecting this way subjectsâ€™ privacy.</p>
