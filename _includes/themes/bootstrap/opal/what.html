<p>Opal is OBiBa's core data managment application. This server application provides all the necessary tools to import, transform and
  describe data. Subjectâ€™s identifiers can also be managed at data import and export time.</p>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Analysis</h4>
<p>Thanks to its integration with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>,
    complex statistical analysis and reports can be performed. The implementation of the
    <a href="/pages/products/datashield">DataSHIELD</a> process allows advanced statistical data analysis across
    multiple studies <i>without sharing and disclosing any individual-level data</i>.
</p>

  <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Integration</h4>
<p>Being integrated with <a href="/pages/products/amber">Amber</a> and <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica</a>, studies
  using Opal can seamlessly and securely import data collected with Amber. They can also create web data
  portals with Mica that query Opal databases to obtain real-time aggregated reports on subject's data.</p>

<p>Secured REST web services are also available allowing to automate server management (Python command line tools) or to
    access to data (from R or Python, or any tools that are web-capable).
