<p>Opal is OBiBa's core data warehouse. This application provides all the necessary tools to import, transform and
  describe data. Subject’s identifiers can also be managed at data import and export time.</p>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Analysis</h4>
<p>Thanks to its integration with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>,
    complex statistical analysis and reports can be performed. The implementation of the
    <a href="/pages/products/datashield">DataSHIELD</a> process allows advanced statistical data analysis across
    multiple studies <i>without sharing and disclosing any individual-level data</i>.
</p>

  <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Integration</h4>
<p>Being integrated with <a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> and <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica</a>, studies
  using Opal can seamlessly and securely import data collected with Onyx. They can also create web data
  portals with Mica that query Opal databases to obtain real-time aggregated reports on subject's data.</p>

<p>Secured REST web services are also available allowing to automate server management (Python command line tools) or to
    access to data (from R or any tools that are web-capable).
