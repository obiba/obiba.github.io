Mica2 is still in developement and will soon replace Mica 9.2, it is stable and may be used in production. However, it does not comes with all the functionnalities available in Mica 9.2 <i>i.e.</i>, you can't yet make dynamic and distributed queries on the datasets in Mica2.  
<p>

<p>Mica2&ndash;the successor of Mica&ndash;is a powerful software application used to create data web portals for large-scale epidemiological studies or multiple-study consortia. </p>

<p>
Mica2 helps studies to provide scientifically robust data visibility and web presence without significant information technology effort. Mica2 provides a
  structured description of consortia, studies, annotated and searchable data dictionaries, and data access request management.
</p>

<p>It is built upon a multitier architecture consisting of a RESTful application server and clients for instance: 
<ul>
	<li>The <em>Mica Web Application</em> from which one can edit information pertaining to indiviudal studies and datasets, and administer secure connections to the other applications of OBiBa software stack. </li>
	<li>The <em>Mica Drupal Client</em> is used to create and display web data portals. It is built upon the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> content management system by means of Drupal modules.</li>
