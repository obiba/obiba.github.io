<p>We are pleased to announce that Opal 2.6 is now available. <a href="http://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/">Opal</a> is OBiBaâ€™s core database application
    for biobanks.</p>

<p>The main new features are related to a better support of time series and longitudinal data both at import/export time and when deriving variables. The multilines are represented in data sources with tabular format (CSV, SPSS and SQL) and having multiple lines per entity:</p>
<ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>import: when several lines per entity are detected, the variables are considered to be "repeatables" and extracted data are value sequences,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>export: when some variables are "repeatables" (i.e. associated data are value sequences), one line per entity/sequence occurrence is written at exportation time,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>derivation: if a variable is defined in more than one of the tables joined in a view, the value extracted from this variable will be a value sequence. Many derivation script methods have been added or improved to facilitate value sequences handling.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">Other notable changes are:</p>
<ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>file download: it is now possible to specify an encryption key when downloading a file or a folder. Downloaded content can be decrypted using the <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> open source program available for free on all systems. This is a lightweight data protection convenient for data exchange on secure platforms,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>files and folders can be renamed,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>the embedded web server Jetty has been upgraded to version 9 for improved security (tested with <a href="https://testssl.sh/" target="_blank">testssl <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>),
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>Maelstrom Research variable taxonomies download now requires a <a href="https://taxonomies.maelstrom-research.org" target="_blank">registration key <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> and the acceptance of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/" target="_blank">associated license <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>.

</ul>

    <strong>Reminder: Java 8 is a requirement</strong>.
    As Java 7 support by Oracle has ended a while ago and because Java 8 is much better at handling collections (parallelization of computations for instance), all OBiBa softwares now require Java 8. See Java instructions specific to your system for upgrading.
