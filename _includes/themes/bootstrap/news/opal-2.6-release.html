<p>We are pleased to announce that Opal 2.6 is now available. <a href="http://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/">Opal</a> is OBiBaâ€™s core database application
    for biobanks.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
	<strong>Java 8 is now a requirement</strong>.
	As Java 7 support by Oracle has ended a while ago and because Java 8 is much better at handling collections (parallelization of computations for instance), all OBiBa softwares now require Java 8. See Java instructions specific to your system for upgrading.
</div>

<p>The main new features are:</p>
<ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>improved performance: parallelization of read and write operations as much as possible,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>identifiers database can use the tabular SQL schema,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>R/DataSHIELD workspaces: R server session can be saved and restored,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>R files API: Opal files can be pushed to/pulled from the R server session,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>R data API: any R object can be sent from the R client session to the R server session.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">To benefit from the new R/DataSHIELD functionalities, the R opal package is to be upgraded as well (at least version 2.3.0).
