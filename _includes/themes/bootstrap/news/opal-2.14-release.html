<p>We are pleased to announce that Opal 2.14 is now available. <a href="http://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/">Opal</a> is OBiBaâ€™s core database application
    for biobanks.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to the funding of the <a href="https://www.eucanconnect.eu/" target="_blank">EUCAN Connect <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> program, this release
  greatly improves the speed of the import and export of datasets, as well as their assignment to R. Thanks to reduced memory needs, much larger datasets can be handled
  (tested with a dataset of 200M data points and a 8G opal server).
</p>

<p>
  This release also supports external identity providers based on the <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>
  protocol for a better integration with the hosting institution's authentication system. The implementation is based on the excellent
  <a href="https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-oauth-openid-connect-sdk" target="_blank">Nimbus OAuth 2.0 SDK <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>.
  This has been tested with <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank">Keycloak <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>, but should work with any
  identity provider system exposing an OpenID Connect configuration discovery entry point.
</p>

<p>
  Additional features implemented:
</p>

<p><ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>refresh of a project (reload data and meta-data from the database),
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>a project can have default settings (preferred export folder and identifiers mapping),
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>views can now be backed up and restored from the web interface (a feature that is still available
      using the Opal Python commands). The views restore action is also to be used when importing Opal Views downloaded from a <a href="../../mica2/3.6/">Mica server (3.6)</a>,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>support of SAS Transport, compressed SPSS, and compressed CSV data formats,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>support of SPSS ranges and missing values specifications are handled at import and export,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>the R option <code>datashield.seed</code> is systematically applied at DataSHIELD server-side R session creation.
      It is specific to an Opal instance and immutable and will be used by DataSHIELD server side functions for consistent random numbers generation,
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>DataSHIELD platform base classes (configuration and R parser) have been extracted from Opal into an external
      library, <a href="https://github.com/obiba/datashield4j" target="_blank">datashield4j <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>, so that other data repositories can implement the DataSHIELD platform.
    </li>
</ul></p>
