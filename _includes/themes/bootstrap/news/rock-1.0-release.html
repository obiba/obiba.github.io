<p>We are pleased to announce that Rock 1.0 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/rock/">Rock</a> is OBiBaâ€™s R computation engine.</p>

<p>
  Rock is a R server that is accessible through a REST API.
</p>

<p>
  Rock is the result of the refactoring of the "Opal's R server" administration application. It is now a fully independent application that can be used directly (see <a href="https://github.com/obiba/rockr" target="_blank">rockr <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> R package) or as the computation backend of an application.
</p>

<p>
  Opal 4.0 uses Rock for providing a scalable and reproducible computation environment for science.
</p>

<p>
  This release was possible thanks to the funding of the <a href="https://www.eucanconnect.eu/" target="_blank">EUCAN Connect <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> program.
