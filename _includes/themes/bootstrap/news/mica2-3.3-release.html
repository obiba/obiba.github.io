<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">We are pleased to announce that Mica2 3.3 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/mica/">Mica</a> is OBiBaâ€™s data web portal for epidemiological studies and networks.</p>

<p>This release introduces the following new functionalities:</p>

<ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Variables can be put in a cart</b>, either from the search page or from a single variable page. This allows the user (researcher) to
      perform several search iteratively in order to constitute a set of variables of interest. This set of variables can be managed, shared
      or used for processing (download, data exploration and much more to come).
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Entities count analysis</b>, a feature introduced with <a href="/pages/news/release/opal/2.10/">Opal 2.10</a> is now available in Mica web portal:
      from the cart of variables, some variables from collected datasets can be selected to perform a participant count analysis.
      This analysis gives the number of participants that are matching variable criteria from different datasets. In addition to know whether a study has
      collected data about a domain of interest (variable search), the researcher can also estimate the number of participants that
      would match its needs (for instance, <em>the number of women older than 50, being smoker and not having cancer</em>).
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Mica R package</b> is now available for extracting from a Mica server the published content. This can be used to provide some
      metrics and reports on the data web portal content. See
      <a href="http://wiki.obiba.org/display/MICADOC/Mica+R+Client+User+Guide" target="_blank">Mica R Client documentation <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>.
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Mica Python Search command</b> is now available for extracting from a Mica server the published content, similarily to what can be get from the Mica R package. See
      <a href="http://wiki.obiba.org/display/MICADOC/Search+Command" target="_blank">Python Search command documentation <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>.
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Search query can be copied</b> from the search page in order to be reusable in R or Python utils. The query expresses criteria about any document type (variable, dataset, study, network)
      and can be applied to retrieve any document type (a key feature of Mica).
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">See <a href="http://wiki.obiba.org/display/MICADOC" target="_blank">Mica documentation <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> for installation and operation instructions.</p>
