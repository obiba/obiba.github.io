<p>We are pleased to announce that Agate 2.10 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/agate/">Agate</a> is OBiBaâ€™s central user profile server.</p>

<p>
  This release offers the possibility to enforce users to set up their two-factor authentication (2FA) secret key. Two enforcement policies are available:
</p>

<p>
  <ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Authenticator app only</b>: user must register its secret key in an authenticator app. This is the recommended policy as authentication requires separate devices.
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Authenticator app or code sent by email</b>: the temporary code is sent at user's email address until its 2FA secret key has been registered in an authenticator app. This policy can be used as a transition phase until the 2FA procedure is fully enforced.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Note: 2FA enforcement policy does not apply to accounts defined in delegated OpenID Connect realms (e.g. case of Agate delegating authentication to a Keycloak server).
