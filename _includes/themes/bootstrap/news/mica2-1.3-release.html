<p>We are pleased to announce that Mica2 1.3 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/mica/">Mica</a> is OBiBaâ€™s data web portal for biobanks.</p>

<p>The main new feature is the introduction of a new type of document: Research Project. A Research Project is the complementary of the Data Access Request. The Data Access Request is meant for setting up a collaboration between a researcher and a consortium/study whereas the Research Project allows to publish the results/status of this collaboration to the public. The Research Project document type is also highly extensible through a <a href="http://schemaform.io/" target="_blank">schemaform <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> configuration.</p>
