<p>We are pleased to announce that Mica2 1.0 is now available. Mica is OBiBaâ€™s data web portal for biobanks.</p>

<p>Mica2 is now officially available as a replacement for Mica. This new architecture is more robust and more domain-driven oriented. The web portal is still based on Drupal, but the Mica domain-specific part is now in an external application: Mica2 server. Mica2 takes also advantage of Opal for the data management (dictionnaries, summaries, access controls, taxonomies).</p>

<p>You can see Mica2 in action as the <a href="https://portal.partnershipfortomorrow.ca" target="_blank">The Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> data portal and the <a href="https://www.maelstrom-research.org/" target="_blank">Maelstrom Research <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> web site.</p>
