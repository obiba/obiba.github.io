<p>We are pleased to announce that Agate 1.5 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/agate/">Agate</a> is OBiBaâ€™s central authentication server.</p>

<p>Thanks to the support of the <a href="https://www.canarie.ca/" target="_blank">Canarie <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> program, this release introduces the ability for Agate to delegate authentication to third party services such as LDAP/Active Directory or a SQL database or <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> providers (for instance <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank">Keycloak <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> is a well established open source solution). Agate can also act itself as an OpenID Connect provider.</p>
