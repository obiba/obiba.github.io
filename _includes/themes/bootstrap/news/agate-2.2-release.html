<p>We are pleased to announce that Agate 2.2 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/agate/">Agate</a> is OBiBaâ€™s central user profile server.</p>

<p>
  A new application setting was added to handle the users who sign-up through the application (like Mica): the user can either be automatically approved or be in the state of pending for approval (thus requiring manual approval by an administrator).
</p>

<p>
  This release was possible thanks to the funding of the <a href="https://www.eucanconnect.eu/" target="_blank">EUCAN Connect <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> (<a href="https://www.eucanconnect.eu/coral-docker-stack-deployment/" target="_blank">Coral</a> integration) program.
