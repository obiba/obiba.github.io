<p>
  This release introduces the following new features:
</p>

<p><ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
  <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
    <b>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</b>: when the user activates 2FA for its account, an additional temporary key will be requested along with its username/password credentials (see <a href="https://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/web-user-guide/my-profile.html#two-factor-authentication">documentation</a>).
  </li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
    <b>Resource views</b>: when a <a href="https://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/resources.html">resource</a> can coerce to a tabular representation, it is now possible to create a view over this resource in order to make the data and their dictionary more accessible for documentation (using Mica) or data extraction (see <a href="https://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/web-user-guide/projects/resources.html">documentation</a>).
  </li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
    <b>Personal Access Token (PAT) expiration</b>: for extra security, an end of life can be defined for the PATs (default is to never expire) and an inactivity timeout is now applied (default is 2 months, with the possibility to renew it, see <a href="https://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/web-user-guide/my-profile.html#personal-access-tokens">PAT documentation</a> and <a href="https://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/latest/admin/configuration.html#login-policy-configuration">Login policy configuration</a>).
  </li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
    <b>Tasks execution per project</b>: tasks (import, export etc.) will be executed in parallel when they belong to different projects; tasks within a single project are still executed sequentially.
  </li>
</ul></p>

<p>
  Opal Python command tool and <a href="https://www.obiba.org/opalr/">Opal R package</a> have been updated according to these new features.
</p>

<p>
  This release is expected to be fully backward compatible.
</p>
