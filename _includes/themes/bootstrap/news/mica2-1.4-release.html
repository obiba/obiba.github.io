<p>We are pleased to announce that Mica2 1.4 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/mica/">Mica</a> is OBiBaâ€™s data web portal for biobanks.</p>

<p>Mica offers a better multi-language support both for the administration interface and for the published content. The user preferred language (see also <a href="/pages/news/release/agate/1.2/">Agate 1.2</a> announcement) is handled accordingly.</p>

<p>The Data Access Forms specifications can now integrate more complex validations (word count, date comparison etc.) and can be printed directly (without the need of defining a PDF template).</p>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">
  Mica2 server upgrade from 1.3 will not affect the data. For the Mica Drupal modules and theme, see <a href="http://wiki.obiba.org/display/MICADOC/Mica+Drupal+Client+Installation+Guide#MicaDrupalClientInstallationGuide-DrupalModulesandThemeUpgrade" target="_blank">upgrade instructions <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>.
