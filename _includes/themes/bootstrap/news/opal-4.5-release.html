    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>MongoDB driver upgrade</b>: latest java driver is used (4.7 at the time of release). No database upgrade is required, as this driver is backward compatible with older versions (see <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/compatibility/" target="_blank">MongoDB Java Driver Compatibility Matrix <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>)
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>SQL drivers upgrade</b>: latest java drivers are used for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL databases. No database upgrade is required.
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Logout with OpenID Connect</b>: the sign-out procedure now cascades the logout action to the external Identity Providers. For instance, if a user authenticates in Opal via an external ID provider (using OpenID Connect), this ID provider session's will be automatically ended after the Opal's one is ended.
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      <b>Logout redirection</b>: it is now possible to specify where the user should be redirected after logout (for instance the institution's home page).
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>
      Many library dependencies upgraded, fixing some potential security issues.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  This release is expected to be fully backward compatible.
