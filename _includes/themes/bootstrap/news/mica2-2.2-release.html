<p>We are pleased to announce that Mica2 2.2 is now available. <a href="/pages/products/mica/">Mica</a> is OBiBaâ€™s data web portal for epidemiological studies and networks.</p>

<p>As with version 2.0, this release offers the possibility to fully configure the data model of the documents (network, study, datasets) that are published in the data portal.</p>

<p>This release contains the following features and improvements:</p>
<ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
	<li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>possibility of hiding search criteria,
	</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>better ordering of search results: datasets are ordered chronologically and variables are ordered by their corresponding study, population and data collection dates as well as their order in the source questionnaire,
	</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>better ordering of documents listing: sorting networks by the number of studies and sorting study datasets chronologically.
	</li>
</ul>

	The connection settings to MongoDB have been changed for a <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/" target="_blank">standard connection string <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> since Mica2 2.0.

  Make sure to backup your installation as Mica2 server upgrade from 1.5 will affect the data: the server will automatically upgrade the data model and re-index the published documents. Default configuration is the data model specified and used by <a href="https://www.maelstrom-research.org/" target="_blank">Maelstrom Research <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>.
