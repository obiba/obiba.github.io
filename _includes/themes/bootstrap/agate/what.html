<p>Agate is a web application that offers users related services to the OBiBa software stack: user authentication, user profile management, user notifications. These services are offered to the declared applications: <a href="../opal">Opal</a>, <a href="../mica">Mica</a> and <a href="../onyx">Onyx</a> and more.
</p>

<p>
Agate ambition is to be a light-weight (but still highly secure) central authentication server: simple to install, to administrate and to integrate with OBiBa applications.
