    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Applications</h4>
</div>

<p>Declared applications can use Agate as their user registry and user notification service. The communication between the application and Agate requires application authentication: an application is assigned a secret key that must be provided when accessing Agate. See corresponding documentation of each OBiBa application to know how to register an application key.</p>

<p>
 Once identified an application can authenticate a user, get its profile, send emails to all users or a group of users having access to this application.
</p>

<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Groups</h4>
</div>

<p>Users can be member of one or several groups. Application access can be declared on a group basis: users who are members of a group inherit from its application accesses.</p>

<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Users</h4>
</div>

<p>
A user is the one who will be authenticated and who will receive the notification emails. A user entry can be done by different way:
</p>

<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>Agate administrator can directly add a new user,</li>
    <li>A user can submit a join request, either from the Agate web interface or from the Mica Drupal client.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user join requests are protected by <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha">Google reCaptcha</a> service.</p>

<p>A user can manage its personal information from the Agate web interface. Password management (first password and password recovery) is automatically done by the exchange of emails between the user and the Agate server: no administrator action is required.</p>

<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Email Templates</h4>
</div>

<p>Email notifications are HTML template-based, allowing to fully customize your communication with users: links to resources, style, site policies etc.</p>

<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Administration</h4>
</div>
<p>With Agate, you can:</p>
<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>Extend user profile attributes (apply to the join request form),</li>
    <li>Manage users, groups and applications,</li>
    <li>Manage user sessions: timeouts and user activity tracking.</li>
</ul>
