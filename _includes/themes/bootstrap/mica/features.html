<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Study Catalogue</h4>
</div>

<p>Mica provides study networks with a study catalogue module to describe in a standardized manner their membership.
    Mica study catalogue includes:</p>

<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>a default list of important study description characteristics that can be customized to reflect specific
        requirements.
    </li>
    <li>support for longitudinal study design with data collection events, sub-populations and recruitment timelines.
    </li>
    <li>advanced study search functionality using facets technologies.</li>
</ul>

<div class="obiba-vertical-margin">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Datasets</h4>
</div>

<p>Studies makes available different datasets to the research community. Mica provides:</p>

<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>A standard menu for its data resources.</li>
    <li>A detailed description of a dataset including a comprehensive dictionary of all the variables provided by the

    </li>
    <li>Advanced variable search functionality using facets technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">Importantly, Mica does not store any record-level data itself. Instead, Mica includes for
    studies using the OBiBa <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a> software as
    main secured database solution, a distributed query engine that enables authorized researchers to obtain real-time

    is used to obtain summary statistics on each variable. Using this approach, no individual-level data passes through
    Mica, yet researchers can assess the suitability of a dataset for their needs. software as main secured database
