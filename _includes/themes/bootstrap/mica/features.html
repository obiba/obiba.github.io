    <li>Advanced variable search functionality using facets,</li>
    <li>A detailed description of a dataset including a comprehensive dictionary of all the variables provided by the dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p class="obiba-top-margin">Importantly, Mica2 does not store any record-level data itself. Instead, Mica2 includes for
    studies using the OBiBa <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> software as
    main secured database solution, a distributed query engine that enables authorized researchers to obtain real-time
    aggregated reports on the exact number of participant with specific characteristics or phenotypes. The same engine
    is used to obtain summary statistics on each variable. Using this approach, no individual-level data passes through
    Mica2, yet researchers can assess the suitability of a dataset for their needs.</p>
