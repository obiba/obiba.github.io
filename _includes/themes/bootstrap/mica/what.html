<p>Mica is a powerful software application used to create data web portals for large-scale epidemiological studies or multiple-study consortia. Mica2 is the successor of Mica.</p>

<p>
Mica helps studies to provide scientifically robust data visibility and web presence without significant information technology effort. Mica provides a structured description of consortia, studies, annotated and searchable data dictionaries, and data access request management.
</p>

<p>It is built upon a multitier architecture consisting of a RESTful application server and clients for instance: 
<ul>
	<li>The <em>Mica Server Web Application</em> from which one can edit information pertaining to indiviudal studies and datasets, and administer secure connections to the other applications of OBiBa software stack.

	</li>
	<li>The <em>Mica Drupal Client</em> is used to create and display web data portals. It is built upon the <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> content management system by means of Drupal modules.
