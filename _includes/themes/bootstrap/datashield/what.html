<p>Some research projects require pooling data from several studies to obtain sample sizes large enough for detecting interactions.
Unfortunately, important ethico-legal constraints often prevent or impede the sharing of individual-level data across multiple studies.</p>

<p>DataSHIELD aims to address this issue. DataSHIELD is a method that enables advanced statistical analysis of
individual-level data from several sources without actually pooling the data from these sources together.

<p>In collaboration with the DataSHIELD team in University of Bristol, The OBiBa team built the complex software
    infrastructure required to run securely DataSHIELD analyses on data stored in <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a>.</p>

 <p>For detailed information about the implementation of the DataSHIELD method in Opal, see the
